# Forecasting Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Changes in the Philippine Peso using Linear Regression

This study explores the use of linear regression to forecast changes in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for the Philippine Peso. The study uses historical economic data to build a predictive model and analyze trends that may impact future PPP values.

## Description

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a key economic indicator that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach. This study aims to forecast PPP fluctuations in the Philippine Peso by applying linear regression to historical data, helping understand how economic factors might influence currency value over time.

## Methodology

- **Data Source**: Historical economic indicators such as exchange rates, inflation rates, and other relevant metrics.
- **Model Used**: Linear Regression
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Files

- `PPP_notebook_source_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full source code, data preprocessing, model training, and visualizations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open PPP_notebook_source_code.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to load data, preprocess, train the linear regression model, and visualize the forecasts.

## Key Findings
- The linear regression model was able to identify general trends in PPP movements.
- Factors such as inflation differential and historical exchange rates showed significant influence on PPP changes.
- The model serves as a simple but effective baseline for economic forecasting.
